# Introducing the Dadroit JSON Generator VSCode Extension

---

Developers and data engineers often require a variety of JSON data samples, when navigating through critical domains such as ETL process testing, API development and testing, and schema validation.

Discover how the Dadroit JSON Generator, now available as a VSCode Extension, is crafted to cater to these tasks, prioritizing simplicity and utility throughout your developmental journey. Targeting developers needing reliable JSON test data files, the extension simplifies data creation to ensure a smooth developmental expedition.

## Quick-Start Your Test Data Creation with Dadroit’s JSON File Generator

Begin by installing the extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dadroit.dadroit-json-generator). 

### Initiate Mock JSON Data Creation with the Default Command

The `Dadroit: Generate JSON Sample` command is an instant route to generate JSON mock data, utilizing a predefined template implanted within the extension as a sample. Upon execution, the template used for this command will be opened in the VSCode editor for you to see through the syntax of this templating language:

Here is the result JSON file generated by the default sample command:

### Generating Custom JSON Data in VSCode

The `Dadroit: Generate JSON` command is your gateway to crafting your custom JSON sample data that aligns with your specific project necessities. This command requires you to have a template sample, which you can write by utilizing our JSON Generator's template language. You can learn more about the template language in the following section. 

## Peeking into the Mechanics of the JSON Generator Template Language

We’ve designed an elaborate template language to be utilized as the blueprint in the JSON data generation process.  

This template language facilitates straightforward JSON templating while maintaining a blend of simplicity and customization through versatile features like `Loops`, `Variants`, and mathematical operations like `Random`, `Count`, `Range`, `Min,` and `Max`. You can get some ideas by checking out [available sample templates](https://github.com/DadroitOrganization/Generator/tree/main/Samples). 

## How to Get the Most Out of Dadroit JSON Generator?

This extension enables you to create precise, project-specific JSON data with customized schema templates, ensuring both flexibility and exactness for your mock data needs, and the toolset has more to offer for you to do so.

### Expanding JSON Data Through Dynamic Looping

Utilize the `$Loop` syntax in the template language to efficiently create dynamic JSON dummy data. Simply define a loop with a specified range using the `$From` and `$To` fields. This way you can generate multiple data entries in one go, making it possible for you to create large, accurate JSON outputs aligned with your project’s schema and requirements.

### Injecting Versatility with Randomness into the Sample Data Generation

Leverage the `$Random` function within the template syntax, to introduce variety into your generated JSON data, providing an extended, realistic data set for thorough testing.

Here you can see an example template for the `$Loop` and `$Random` syntaxes:

```json
{
	"Hi": {
		"$Loop": {
			"$From": 1,
			"$To": 10,
			"$Block": {
				"Message": {
					"$Format": {
						"$Template": {"$Random": ["Hi ? and ?", "Hello? or ?"]},
						"$Value": [
						{"$Random": ["Jim", "Jack", "Jake", "Jamie"]},
						{"$Random": ["Julia", "Jessica"]}
						]
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The result of using this template with the `Dadroit: Generate JSON`  command would be something like this:
