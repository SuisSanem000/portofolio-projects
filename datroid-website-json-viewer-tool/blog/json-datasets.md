# List of Open Datasets That Can Be Used As JSON Sample Data

---

Where to find free and open dataset for your next JSON data-required project? There are some influential organizations and businesses that publicly provide their data for educational and research purposes. 

Say, for example, you are a data scientist searching for free and open data sources for your academic project. Or need some mock data to test your software system, and you need a head start. Here you'll find a good start from these open and free data sources to look up. 

In this post, we'll give you an organized and diverse list of these resources, which we picked based on important and useful necessities. We specifically picked those that offer JSON format.

  documentation.

## So, to wrap it up.
We carefully picked and described these websites to give you a thorough overview of open-data providers out there. We focused on JSON because it is almost the de facto and chosen format to exchange data everyplace in the tech industry. JSON comes in handy, particularly when facing the [challenge of opening large-scale data files](https://dadroit.com/blog/open-big-json/).
And on your journey, if you had a JSON file to explore, you can use our Dadroit JSON Viewer, it is fast, and free for academics!
